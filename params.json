{"name":"Rake-arduino","body":"## Usage\r\n_`rake-arduino` is very pre-alpha at the moment. Be prepared to find and fix a\r\nlot of bugs while using it._\r\n\r\nAfter installing the gem (see below), simply add a Rakefile that looks like\r\nthis to the root of your project:\r\n\r\n    require 'rubygems'\r\n    require 'rake/arduino'\r\n\r\n    Rake::Arduino::Sketch.new do |s|\r\n      s.sources << \"MySketch.cpp\"\r\n      s.libraries << \"Servo\"\r\n\r\n      s.board = Rake::Arduino::Board[\"Arduino Uno\"]\r\n    end\r\n\r\nSee the `examples` directory for more advanced usage.\r\n\r\nThen, to build your project run:\r\n\r\n    rake\r\n\r\nTo upload it to your arduino:\r\n\r\n    rake upload\r\n\r\nIf your arduino installation is somewhere non-standard, you'll need to\r\nconfigure that at the top of your Rakefile:\r\n\r\n    Rake::Arduino.configure do |c|\r\n      c.home = \"/home/me/apps/arduino-0022\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou'll need ruby and rubygems installed (use your system's package manager, or\r\nRVM).\r\n\r\nAs a gem:\r\n\r\n    gem install rake-arduino\r\n\r\nFrom source:\r\n\r\n    gem install bundler rake\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/wjbuys/rake-arduino\r\n    cd rake-arduino\r\n    rake install\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nArduino is great. The arduino IDE: not so great. Once your project moves beyond\r\na nontrivial size, it's a massive pain to use. Sorry Arduino team, but it's\r\njust painful and ugly (and stupid, if you're used to Vim/Emacs).\r\n\r\nAt this point all the gurus say: \"Just use a `Makefile`!\". Unfortunately, this\r\nbecomes a very roll-your-own mission (there's no centrally maintained version).\r\n\r\nAlso, the `Makefile` syntax makes my eyes bleed. Inevitably multiple copies of\r\nthe same `Makefile` with minor tweaks will end up around all my projects, because\r\nI'm lazy.\r\n\r\n*Luckily, there's a solution: _Rake_.* Rake is Ruby, so\r\n\r\n1. the syntax is gorgeous,\r\n1. you get a real programming language to do additional pre-processing,\r\n1. and you can wrap common logic up neatly into a central library.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n1. Support `.pde` sketch pre-processing\r\n1. Add some specs (I just ripped this out of a project I was working on, so no\r\n   tests :( )\r\n1.
